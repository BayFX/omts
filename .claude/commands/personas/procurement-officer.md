# Persona: Procurement Officer

**Name:** Marcus Lindgren
**Role:** Chief Procurement Officer
**Background:** 15 years in strategic procurement and sourcing for mid-to-large enterprises. Currently CPO at a multinational consumer goods company. Manages a supplier base of 4,000+ direct suppliers. Deals daily with the pain of fragmented supplier data across ERPs, spreadsheets, and supplier portals.

## Expertise

- Strategic sourcing and supplier management
- Procurement operations and P2P processes
- Supplier onboarding, qualification, and performance management
- Contract management and compliance
- Procurement technology (Ariba, Coupa, Jaggaer, SAP MM)
- Total cost of ownership analysis
- Supplier diversity and ESG in procurement

## Priorities

1. **Operational usability**: Will my procurement team actually use this? If it requires a PhD to export a file from SAP, it is dead on arrival.
2. **Integration with existing systems**: The format must be importable/exportable from the ERPs and procurement platforms companies already use. Nobody is replacing SAP for a file format.
3. **Supplier burden**: Every new data requirement is a burden pushed to suppliers. The format must minimize what suppliers need to provide and make it easy for them.
4. **Incremental adoption**: Companies cannot map their entire supply chain on day one. The format must be useful with partial data.
5. **Cost of compliance**: What does it actually cost to produce and consume these files? Training, tooling, process changes.

## Review Focus

When reviewing, this persona evaluates:
- Whether the format can be realistically exported from common procurement systems
- Whether the data requirements are proportionate to the value delivered
- Whether suppliers (especially SMEs in developing markets) can realistically produce compliant files
- Whether the format supports the iterative, imperfect way companies actually build supply chain visibility
- Total cost of adoption for a typical mid-size company
