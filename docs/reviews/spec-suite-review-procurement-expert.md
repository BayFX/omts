## Assessment

I have spent fifteen years managing supplier bases of 4,000+ direct suppliers across SAP, Oracle, and D365 landscapes. The single greatest friction point in my operation is not sourcing strategy or negotiation -- it is the inability to get clean, consistent supplier data out of our own systems and reconcile it with what our partners see. OMTSF attacks this problem at the right layer: not by building another platform, but by defining a portable file format that lets two parties exchange supplier network data without a six-month integration project. That instinct is correct, and the spec suite reflects a mature understanding of the real-world messiness of supplier master data.

The specification suite's most procurement-relevant design decisions are sound. First-class treatment of internal identifiers (SPEC-002) means my team can produce a valid `.omts` file today with nothing more than SAP `LIFNR` codes -- no LEI acquisition program required. The tiered validation model (L1 structural, L2 completeness, L3 enrichment) mirrors exactly how procurement data quality works in practice: you start with what the ERP gives you and enrich over time. The ERP integration guide (SPEC-005) has accurate SAP S/4HANA field mappings -- someone who has actually worked with `LFA1`, `EINA`/`EINE`, and `EKKO`/`EKPO` wrote this, and that credibility matters when I am asking my IT team to build an extractor.

However, the spec suite remains stronger as a data model than as an operational procurement tool. The gap between "technically valid format" and "something my procurement team will actually adopt" is where this review focuses. Six specifications totaling hundreds of pages will not be read by the category managers, supplier quality engineers, or sourcing analysts who need to produce and consume these files. The supplier-facing workflow -- what do I actually ask a Tier-2 supplier to provide? -- is absent. And the cost dimension of identifier enrichment, which determines whether adoption is viable for mid-market companies without dedicated data governance teams, is never addressed.

## Strengths

- **Internal identifiers as first-class citizens (SPEC-002, Section 5.1).** This is the single most important design decision for procurement adoption. Every ERP system assigns vendor numbers; almost none assign LEIs. A format that rejects files without external identifiers would be dead on arrival. OMTSF gets this right.
- **Tiered validation enabling incremental adoption (SPEC-002, Sections 6.1-6.3).** A file with only `internal` identifiers passes L1 validation. This means my team can export today and enrich tomorrow. No "all or nothing" compliance barrier.
- **Accurate SAP S/4HANA mapping (SPEC-005, Section 2).** The `LFA1` vendor master mapping, the `EINA`/`EINE` purchasing info record to `supplies` edge derivation, and the `EKKO-BSART` subcontracting detection are technically correct. This is not a theoretical mapping; it reflects how SAP procurement data actually works.
- **Supply relationship edge taxonomy (SPEC-001, Section 6).** The distinction between `supplies`, `subcontracts`, `tolls`, `distributes`, and `brokers` maps cleanly to how procurement teams categorize supplier relationships. The regulatory annotations (CSDDD Article 3(e), LkSG Section 2(7)) connect the graph to the compliance use case that drives budget for this work.
- **Composite identifier model (SPEC-002, Section 2).** No single identifier scheme covers the global supplier base. The composite model -- carry LEI where available, DUNS where subscribed, VAT always, internal always -- matches procurement reality. The scheme-qualified canonical form (`duns:081466849`) eliminates the ambiguity that plagues spreadsheet-based supplier data exchange.
- **Selective disclosure via boundary references (SPEC-004).** Suppliers will not share their full sub-tier network. The ability to redact nodes while preserving graph connectivity addresses the competitive sensitivity concern that kills most multi-tier visibility initiatives.
- **Merge semantics with transitive closure (SPEC-003).** The ability to merge files from different parties without bilateral coordination is the core value proposition. The algebraic properties (commutativity, associativity, idempotency) mean my team and a supplier's team can independently produce files that merge correctly without agreeing on IDs upfront.
- **`same_as` edge for dedup uncertainty (SPEC-003, Section 7).** In a 20,000-vendor SAP system with 10% duplicates, my team cannot always confirm whether two records are the same entity. The `same_as` edge with confidence levels (`definite`, `probable`, `possible`) reflects operational reality.
- **Extension mechanism via reverse-domain notation (SPEC-001, Section 8).** Procurement-specific properties (approved/blocked status, payment terms, category assignments) can be added without waiting for spec revisions. This is critical for real-world adoption where every organization has unique metadata requirements.
- **Attestation model (SPEC-001, Section 4.5).** SA8000 certifications, EUDR due diligence statements, and SMETA audit results are first-class objects linked to facilities. This directly supports supplier qualification workflows.

## Concerns

- **[Critical] No supplier-facing data collection guidance.** The spec defines what data looks like in a file, but provides zero guidance on how to collect that data from suppliers. In procurement, supplier onboarding and data collection is the operational bottleneck. What portal, questionnaire, or template does a Tier-2 supplier use to contribute data? Without this, adoption will stall at the buyer-side export use case and never reach multi-tier.
- **[Critical] No cost analysis or ROI framework for identifier enrichment.** LEI costs $50-200/year per entity. DUNS hierarchy data requires a D&B subscription at $50K-250K/year. For a 4,000-supplier base, full LEI coverage could cost $200K-800K annually. SPEC-005's enrichment lifecycle (Section 5) describes the workflow but never acknowledges the cost. Without a cost-ordered enrichment path, procurement leaders cannot build a business case.
- **[Major] No procurement-specific relationship metadata.** The supply edge types lack properties that procurement teams need daily: supplier approval status (approved, blocked, conditional), contract terms (payment terms, incoterms), spend category, risk tier assignment, and preferred/backup designation. These are essential for the format to be useful beyond regulatory compliance filing.
- **[Major] Oracle SCM Cloud and D365 mappings are too shallow (SPEC-005, Sections 3-4).** The SAP mapping is at field-level detail with table names. Oracle and D365 mappings are surface-level -- field names without REST API endpoints, OData entities, or module-specific extraction guidance. My Oracle and D365 instances represent 40% of my ERP landscape. I cannot hand Section 3 or 4 to my integration team and get an extractor built.
- **[Major] No delta/incremental update model.** A full re-export of a 20,000-vendor master for every change is operationally infeasible. SPEC-003 defines snapshot merge but provides no mechanism for incremental updates (add 3 suppliers, update 1 address, deactivate 2). This is a blocking gap for production deployment.
- **[Major] SAP Business Partner model (`BUT000`/`BUT0ID`) not mapped.** Greenfield S/4HANA deployments use the Business Partner model, not the legacy vendor master (`LFA1`). The `BUT0ID` table provides typed identifier storage that maps more cleanly to OMTSF identifier records than `STCD1`/`STCD2`. Omitting this mapping makes SPEC-005 incomplete for modern SAP landscapes.
- **[Major] No multi-ERP deduplication worked example.** Organizations with multiple ERP instances (common in multinationals post-M&A) will have the same supplier appearing as different vendor numbers across systems. SPEC-003, Section 8 mentions this scenario but provides no worked example showing how three `internal` identifiers from SAP, Oracle, and D365 resolve to a single entity.
- **[Minor] `authority` naming convention for `internal` scheme is informal.** SPEC-002 recommends `{system-type}-{instance-id}` (e.g., `sap-mm-prod`) but does not formalize this. Without a controlled convention, two teams exporting from the same SAP instance might use `sap-prod-100`, `sap-mm-prod`, or `SAP_ECC_PROD`, making internal identifier correlation unreliable.
- **[Minor] No guidance on handling M&A events in procurement context.** When a supplier is acquired, the `former_identity` edge (SPEC-001, Section 5.4) models the corporate event but does not address the procurement-specific consequences: open POs, active contracts, qualification status transfer, and payment term renegotiation.
- **[Minor] Six specifications with no quick-start guide.** A category manager who needs to understand "what do I need to produce?" faces six documents with 200+ pages of combined content. A one-page minimum viable file guide with a copy-pasteable template would dramatically reduce the adoption barrier.

## Recommendations

| # | Priority | Recommendation |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 1 | P0 | **Publish a cost-ordered identifier enrichment path.** Document the realistic cost per identifier scheme: free (national registries via OpenCorporates, GLEIF bulk download), low-cost (VAT validation via VIES), moderate (DUNS number assignment -- free, but hierarchy data requires subscription), high-cost (LEI registration at $50-200/entity/year). This enables procurement leaders to build a phased enrichment business case. |
| 2 | P0 | **Create a supplier data collection guide.** Define a minimum viable data request for suppliers: legal name, jurisdiction, one external identifier (registration number preferred), facility addresses. Provide a template CSV/JSON that a Tier-2 supplier with no OMTSF tooling can fill out. This is what procurement teams will actually distribute. |
| 3 | P1 | **Add procurement-specific edge properties as a recommended extension namespace.** Define `com.omtsf.procurement` extension properties: `approval_status` (approved/blocked/conditional/pending), `spend_category`, `risk_tier`, `payment_terms`, `preferred_status`. Keep them as extensions, not core, but provide the schema so every adopter does not reinvent them. |
| 4 | P1 | **Expand Oracle SCM Cloud and D365 mappings to API-level detail.** For Oracle: reference `ProcurementSuppliers` REST resource, `PurchaseOrders` resource, specific field paths. For D365: reference `VendTable` OData entity, `PurchaseOrderHeaderV2` entity, Finance and Operations Data Entity framework. |
| 5 | P1 | **Add SAP Business Partner model mapping.** Map `BUT000` (BP master), `BUT0ID` (identification numbers with `ID_TYPE`), `BUT021_FS` (financial services relations), and relevant CDS views (`I_BusinessPartner`, `I_Supplier`). |
| 6 | P1 | **Publish a worked multi-ERP deduplication example.** Show "Acme GmbH" appearing as `LIFNR V-100234` in SAP, `VENDOR_ID 50042` in Oracle, and `VendAccount V00891` in D365, with DUNS and VAT as merge keys, producing a single organization node with three `internal` identifiers. |
| 7 | P1 | **Create a one-page minimum viable file quick-start.** Target audience: a procurement analyst who has never seen the spec. Contents: one complete `.omts` file with two organizations, one `supplies` edge, `internal` identifiers only. Copy-pasteable. Under 50 lines. |
| 8 | P2 | **Define a delta/patch update envelope.** File-level `update_type` field (`snapshot` vs `delta`), with delta files containing add/modify/remove operations referencing entities by identifier. Inherit `disclosure_scope` constraints. |
| 9 | P2 | **Formalize the `authority` naming convention for `internal` identifiers.** Propose a registry or at minimum a normative pattern: `{vendor}-{module}-{instance}` (e.g., `sap-mm-prod-100`, `oracle-scm-us-east`, `d365-fo-emea`). |
| 10 | P2 | **Add M&A operational guidance for procurement teams.** When `former_identity` edges exist, provide guidance on: linking open POs to successor entity, transferring qualification status, handling contract novation, and managing the transition period where both old and new identifiers are active. |

## Cross-Expert Notes

- **To Enterprise Integration Expert:** Your SAP Business Partner model gap (M7 in R2 panel report) and Oracle/D365 depth concern (M8) are my top integration-blocking issues. If the ERP mappings are not detailed enough for my integration team to build an extractor without reverse-engineering, the spec will not reach production deployment. I strongly support co-authoring expanded mappings.
- **To Supply Chain Expert:** Your recommendation for quantitative supply edge properties (volume, annual value, criticality) aligns with my need for procurement-specific metadata. We should coordinate on a shared extension namespace rather than defining overlapping extensions -- procurement spend data and supply chain volume data are often the same underlying numbers from different perspectives.
- **To Open Source Strategy Expert:** The single most impactful ecosystem deliverable for procurement adoption is a reference SAP S/4HANA extractor that produces valid `.omts` files. If I can point my ABAP team at a working CDS view + extraction program, adoption moves from "evaluate the spec" to "run the extractor." I would co-sponsor this as a priority community project.
- **To Standards Expert:** Your ISO 6523 ICD mapping table (P1-3 in R2 panel) has direct procurement relevance -- PEPPOL e-invoicing identifiers are becoming mandatory in EU public procurement, and my AP team already deals with PEPPOL participant IDs. A bidirectional conversion algorithm would let OMTSF files interoperate with e-invoicing infrastructure.
- **To Regulatory Compliance Expert:** The attestation model (SPEC-001, Section 4.5) covers my supplier qualification use case well, but I need attestation revocation and supersession (your P1-12) urgently. When an SA8000 certification is revoked mid-validity, the current model cannot distinguish it from an active certification. This has compliance-blocking implications.
- **To Security & Privacy Expert:** Selective disclosure (SPEC-004) is well-designed for the multi-tier case where I share redacted subgraphs with customers. However, I need guidance on what happens when a customer requests the full unredacted graph under CSDDD Article 8 information-sharing obligations. Can a buyer compel disclosure of boundary-referenced nodes? This is a legal question the spec should at least acknowledge.
- **To Data Format Expert:** File size matters. A 4,000-supplier graph with facilities, goods, and attestations could produce files in the tens of megabytes as JSON. I need to understand whether compression is expected at the transport layer or whether the spec will eventually support a binary encoding. Email attachment limits and ERP upload size constraints are real operational barriers.
- **To Entity Identification Expert:** Your confidence hierarchy for identifier scheme matches (P1-19 in R2 panel) is critical for my enrichment workflow. When my data steward resolves a supplier to both a DUNS and an LEI, and they point to different entities, she needs documented guidance on which one to trust. LEI-as-authoritative is the right default, but the guidance should be explicit and accessible.
