## Assessment

I manage a supplier base of 4,000+ direct suppliers across SAP, Oracle, and D365 landscapes. The central friction in my operation is not strategy -- it is the inability to reconcile fragmented supplier data across systems and trading partners. OMTS targets the correct problem: a portable exchange format that enables supply chain graph sharing without a multi-year integration project. After reviewing the full revised spec suite, I can confirm that the specification team has addressed many of the critical and major issues raised in the initial panel round. The result is materially stronger as a procurement-usable artifact.

The most significant improvements for procurement adoption are: the SAP Business Partner model mapping (SPEC-005, Section 2.4), which means the ERP guide now covers both legacy `LFA1` and greenfield S/4HANA `BUT000`/`BUT0ID` landscapes; the addition of volume, annual value, and currency properties on `supplies` and `subcontracts` edges (SPEC-001, Sections 6.1-6.2), which enables meaningful spend analysis; the `data_quality` metadata on nodes and edges (SPEC-001, Section 8.3), which lets my data steward distinguish a GLEIF-verified LEI from a supplier-questionnaire self-report; the `consignment` node type (SPEC-001, Section 4.6) and `composed_of` edge (SPEC-001, Section 6.8) for material traceability; the `sells_to` edge (SPEC-001, Section 6.9) for downstream CSDDD obligations; attestation lifecycle states including `suspended` and `revoked` (SPEC-001, Section 4.5); the temporal compatibility check in the merge identity predicate (SPEC-003, Section 2); and the file integrity mechanism with SHA-256 and optional digital signatures (SPEC-004, Section 6). The STCD1/STCD2 tax field disambiguation table (SPEC-005, Section 2.5) alone will save my SAP integration team a week of reverse-engineering.

However, the spec suite remains stronger as a data model definition than as an operational procurement tool. The gap between "technically correct format" and "something my procurement team and suppliers will actually adopt" is where residual concerns concentrate. Six specifications -- even well-structured ones -- present a formidable entry barrier for the category managers and sourcing analysts who need to produce and consume these files. Supplier-facing workflows, cost-of-adoption guidance, and incremental onboarding paths remain unaddressed. These are not theoretical concerns; in my experience, the best-designed data format in the world fails if suppliers cannot produce compliant files without dedicated technical support.

## Strengths

- **Internal identifiers as first-class citizens (SPEC-002, Section 5.1, `internal` scheme).** The single most important decision for procurement adoption. Every ERP assigns vendor numbers; almost none assign LEIs. Requiring external identifiers for validity would kill adoption. OMTS correctly makes a file with only `internal` identifiers structurally valid at L1.
- **Tiered validation enabling incremental adoption (SPEC-002, Sections 6.1-6.3).** L1 structural, L2 completeness, L3 enrichment maps precisely to how procurement data quality evolves: start with what the ERP gives you, enrich over time. No "all or nothing" barrier.
- **SAP S/4HANA mapping now covers both legacy and Business Partner model (SPEC-005, Sections 2.1-2.4).** The `LFA1` vendor master and `BUT000`/`BUT0ID` Business Partner mappings with `IDTYPE`-to-scheme translation table are accurate and actionable. I can hand Section 2 to my ABAP team and get an extractor built.
- **Supply edge properties now include volume and spend (SPEC-001, Section 6.1).** `volume`, `volume_unit`, `annual_value`, `value_currency`, and `tier` on `supplies` edges enable meaningful procurement analytics -- spend concentration, sole-source risk, tier identification. This was a critical gap previously.
- **Data quality metadata (SPEC-001, Section 8.3).** The `confidence` enum (`verified`, `reported`, `inferred`, `estimated`) with `source` and `last_verified` enables risk-weighted data governance. My data steward can now distinguish a GLEIF API-verified LEI from a supplier questionnaire self-report.
- **Attestation lifecycle states (SPEC-001, Section 4.5, `status` field).** The `active`/`suspended`/`revoked`/`expired`/`withdrawn` enum is distinct from `valid_to` and `outcome`. This means when an SA8000 certification is revoked mid-validity, the graph correctly reflects it. Critical for supplier qualification workflows.
- **STCD1/STCD2 disambiguation (SPEC-005, Section 2.5).** The country-specific tax field mapping table saves significant implementation effort. The guidance to default to `internal` when the identifier type is ambiguous is operationally correct.
- **Selective disclosure via boundary references (SPEC-004, Section 4).** Suppliers will not share their full sub-tier network. Redacting nodes while preserving graph connectivity addresses the competitive sensitivity barrier that kills most multi-tier visibility initiatives.
- **Merge with temporal safety (SPEC-003, Section 2).** The temporal compatibility check prevents false merges from reassigned DUNS/GLN identifiers -- a real-world problem I have encountered when a D&B number was recycled after an entity dissolution.
- **File integrity (SPEC-004, Section 6).** SHA-256 content hash with optional Ed25519/ECDSA signatures enables tamper detection for files exchanged across organizational boundaries. This matters when OMTS files feed regulatory submissions.
- **Extension mechanism (SPEC-001, Section 8).** Reverse-domain notation for custom node and edge types means procurement-specific metadata (approved/blocked status, payment terms, category assignments) can be added without waiting for spec revisions.

## Concerns

- **[Critical] No supplier-facing data collection guidance.** The spec defines what data looks like in a file but provides zero guidance on how to collect that data from suppliers. Supplier onboarding and data collection is the operational bottleneck in procurement. What questionnaire, template, or minimal data request does a Tier-2 supplier in Vietnam or Bangladesh fill out? The EU Omnibus I package now allows SMEs to refuse data requests beyond voluntary SME sustainability standards ([Sphera, 2025](https://sphera.com/resources/blog/csddd-is-changing-heres-what-every-supply-chain-leader-needs-to-know/)). Without a minimal-viable data collection template, OMTS adoption stalls at buyer-side export and never reaches the multi-tier visibility that is its core value proposition.
- **[Critical] No cost analysis or ROI framework for identifier enrichment.** LEI registration costs $50-200/year per entity ([LEI Worldwide](https://www.lei-worldwide.com/lei-cost.html)). SMEs often see LEI as administratively burdensome ([RapidLEI, 2026](https://rapidlei.com/lei-predictions-2026/)). DUNS hierarchy data requires a D&B subscription at $50K-250K/year. For a 4,000-supplier base, full LEI coverage could cost $200K-800K annually. SPEC-005 Section 5 describes the enrichment lifecycle but never acknowledges the cost. Without a cost-ordered enrichment path showing free sources (GLEIF bulk download, OpenCorporates, VIES VAT validation) versus paid sources (D&B Family Tree, commercial entity resolution), procurement leaders cannot build a business case.
- **[Major] Oracle SCM Cloud and D365 mappings remain shallow (SPEC-005, Sections 3-4).** The SAP mapping is now at field-and-table-level detail with both legacy and BP model coverage. Oracle and D365 mappings still lack REST API endpoint paths, OData entity names for D365 Finance and Operations, and module-specific extraction guidance. Oracle and D365 represent approximately 40% of my ERP landscape. An integration team cannot build an extractor from Sections 3-4 without substantial independent research.
- **[Major] No delta/incremental update model.** Full re-export of a 20,000+ vendor master for every change is operationally infeasible. ERP change document tables (SAP `CDHDR`/`CDPOS`, Oracle audit columns) produce incremental deltas. SPEC-003 defines snapshot merge but provides no mechanism for expressing "add 3 suppliers, update 1 address, deactivate 2 relationships." This is a blocking gap for production deployment at scale.
- **[Major] No multi-ERP deduplication worked example.** Organizations with multiple ERP instances (common post-M&A) will have the same supplier appearing as different vendor numbers across systems. SPEC-003 Section 8 mentions intra-file deduplication but provides no end-to-end worked example showing how a supplier appearing as `LIFNR V-100234` in SAP, `SupplierId 50042` in Oracle, and `VendAccount V00891` in D365 resolves to a single `organization` node via shared DUNS or VAT as merge keys.
- **[Major] No procurement-specific relationship metadata.** While `supplies` edges now carry volume and value, the format still lacks properties that procurement teams need daily: supplier approval status (approved/blocked/conditional), payment terms, incoterms, spend category, risk tier, and preferred/backup designation. These are essential for the format to serve as more than a compliance filing artifact. They should be defined as a recommended extension namespace so every adopter does not reinvent them.
- **[Minor] `authority` naming convention for `internal` identifiers is informal.** SPEC-005 Section 1.1 recommends `{system_type}-{instance_id}[-{client}]` but this is not enforced at any validation level. Two teams exporting from the same SAP instance might use `sap-prod-100`, `sap-mm-prod`, or `SAP_ECC_PROD`, making internal identifier correlation unreliable. L2 validation should at least warn on non-conforming patterns.
- **[Minor] No quick-start guide or minimum viable file template.** Six specifications with hundreds of combined pages is impenetrable for a category manager who needs to understand "what do I produce?" A one-page guide with a copy-pasteable 30-line `.omts` file showing two organizations, one `supplies` edge, and `internal` identifiers only would dramatically reduce the adoption barrier.
- **[Minor] No M&A operational guidance for procurement.** The `former_identity` edge (SPEC-001, Section 5.4) models corporate events but does not address procurement consequences: open POs, active contracts, qualification status transfer, and the transition period where both old and new entity identifiers are active in ERP systems.

## Recommendations

| # | Priority | Recommendation |
|---|----------|---------------|
| 1 | P0 | **Create a supplier data collection guide.** Define a minimum viable data request for suppliers: legal name, jurisdiction, one external identifier (national registration number preferred), facility addresses. Provide a template CSV or simplified JSON that a Tier-2 SME supplier with no OMTS tooling can fill out. Align with the EU Omnibus I voluntary SME sustainability standard boundaries. This is what procurement teams will actually distribute to their supply base. |
| 2 | P0 | **Publish a cost-ordered identifier enrichment path.** Document the realistic cost and availability per scheme: free (GLEIF bulk download for LEI lookup, national registry APIs, VIES for EU VAT validation), low-cost (OpenCorporates for cross-jurisdictional registry search), moderate (DUNS number assignment is free but hierarchy data requires subscription), high-cost (LEI registration at $50-200/entity/year). This enables procurement leaders to build a phased enrichment business case. |
| 3 | P1 | **Expand Oracle SCM Cloud and D365 mappings to API-level detail.** For Oracle: reference `fscmRestApi/resources/latest/suppliers` endpoint, `PurchaseOrders` resource, specific nested child resource paths. For D365: reference `VendorV2` OData entity, `PurchaseOrderHeaderV2` data entity, Finance and Operations Data Entity framework patterns. Match the quality of the SAP mapping. |
| 4 | P1 | **Publish a worked multi-ERP deduplication example.** Show "Acme GmbH" appearing as `LIFNR V-100234` (SAP, `authority: sap-prod-100`), `SupplierId 50042` (Oracle, `authority: oracle-scm-eu`), and `VendAccount V00891` (D365, `authority: d365-fo-emea`), with shared `duns:081466849` and `vat:DE:DE123456789` as merge keys, producing a single `organization` node carrying three `internal` identifiers. Walk through the merge identity predicate step by step. |
| 5 | P1 | **Define a recommended procurement extension namespace.** Publish `com.omts.procurement` extension properties: `approval_status` (approved/blocked/conditional/pending), `spend_category` (string), `risk_tier` (integer), `payment_terms` (string), `preferred_status` (boolean). Keep them as extensions not core, but provide the schema so the ecosystem converges. |
| 6 | P1 | **Create a one-page minimum viable file quick-start.** Target audience: a procurement analyst who has never seen the spec. Contents: one complete `.omts` file with two organizations, one `supplies` edge, `internal` identifiers only. Copy-pasteable. Under 50 lines. No jargon. |
| 7 | P2 | **Define a delta/patch update envelope.** File-level `update_type` field (`snapshot` vs `delta`), with delta files containing add/modify/remove operations referencing entities by identifier. Inherit `disclosure_scope` constraints. Delta files should default to `restricted` sensitivity per the Security & Privacy Expert's guidance. |
| 8 | P2 | **Formalize the `authority` naming convention for `internal` identifiers at L2.** Promote the `{system_type}-{instance_id}[-{client}]` convention from informative guidance to an L2 validation pattern. Emit a warning when `authority` values on `internal` identifiers do not match `^[a-z0-9][-a-z0-9]*$`. |
| 9 | P2 | **Add M&A operational guidance for procurement.** When `former_identity` edges exist, provide guidance on: linking open POs to successor entity, transferring qualification/approval status, handling contract novation, and managing the transition period where both old and new identifiers are active. |
| 10 | P2 | **Define a recommended procurement extension namespace for contract metadata.** Add `com.omts.procurement.contract` extension for: `incoterms` (string), `contract_start`/`contract_end` (dates), `auto_renewal` (boolean), `termination_notice_days` (integer). Coordinate with Supply Chain Expert on shared volume/value semantics to avoid duplication. |

## Cross-Expert Notes

- **To Enterprise Integration Expert:** The Oracle and D365 depth gap remains the top integration-blocking issue for my ERP landscape. If Sections 3-4 of SPEC-005 are not detailed enough for an integration team to build an extractor without reverse-engineering, 40% of my ERP estate cannot participate. I would co-author expanded mappings for both platforms.
- **To Supply Chain Expert:** The addition of `volume`, `volume_unit`, `annual_value`, and `value_currency` on supply edges resolves our shared concern from the initial review. We should now coordinate on the procurement extension namespace to avoid defining overlapping extensions for spend categories and volume metrics.
- **To Open Source Strategy Expert:** The single most impactful ecosystem deliverable for procurement adoption remains a reference SAP S/4HANA extractor producing valid `.omts` files. The SAP Business Partner mapping (SPEC-005, Section 2.4) is now detailed enough to serve as the functional specification for such an extractor. I would co-sponsor this as a priority community project targeting the LkSG/German automotive adoption wedge.
- **To Regulatory Compliance Expert:** The attestation lifecycle states (`active`/`suspended`/`revoked`/`expired`/`withdrawn`) resolve my prior concern about distinguishing revoked certifications. One remaining gap: when my supplier qualification team revokes internal approval (not a third-party certification), that status lives in the procurement extension namespace, not in the attestation model. We should ensure the extension pattern accommodates buyer-side qualification decisions.
- **To Security & Privacy Expert:** Selective disclosure is well-designed for sharing redacted subgraphs with customers. I still need guidance on what happens when a buyer invokes CSDDD Article 8 information-sharing obligations and requests the full unredacted graph. Can a downstream customer compel disclosure of boundary-referenced nodes? This is a legal question the spec should at least acknowledge.
- **To Data Format Expert:** File size matters operationally. A 4,000-supplier graph with facilities, goods, attestations, and consignments could produce files in the tens of megabytes as JSON. Email attachment limits (typically 25MB) and ERP upload constraints are real barriers. The compression envelope (`P2` recommendation in the panel report) should be prioritized if production adoption is targeted.
- **To Entity Identification Expert:** The `data_quality` metadata and `verification_status` on identifier records address the confidence gap. The remaining question for my enrichment workflow: when a data steward resolves a supplier to both a DUNS and an LEI and they point to different entities, the spec provides no explicit guidance on which identifier to trust. LEI-as-authoritative is the right default given its regulatory backing, but the guidance should be documented in SPEC-002 or SPEC-005.
